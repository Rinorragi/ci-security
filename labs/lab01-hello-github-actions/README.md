# Lab01 - Hello GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a powerful CI/CD platform that lets you automate tasks directly from your GitHub repository.

In this lab, you’ll set up a simple workflow to print text as a “Hello World” introduction. This first step will help you understand how GitHub Actions works, laying the groundwork for more complex automations later in the workshop.

## Run a simple GitHub action
