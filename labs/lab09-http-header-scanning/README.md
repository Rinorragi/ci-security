| Target         | Check if your application HTTP security headers are implemented as they should                                                                         |

| Threat         | [OWASP TOP 10: Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/). Also E.g. Content-Security-Policy protects against XSS. |
| Detect         | Misconfiguration in HTTP headers                                                                                                                       |
| Prevent        | Misconfigurations in HTTP headers                                                                                                                      |

| Known problems | You need live target and sometimes it is not public. So you might need an agent inside your network to do this.                                        |

HTTP headers play a vital role in securing web applications. Scanning these headers can uncover missing or misconfigured security directives — such as `Content-Security-Policy` or `Strict-Transport-Security` — that help defend against attacks like clickjacking and cross-site scripting. By using tools like `Mozilla Observatory`, you can quickly assess your site’s HTTP security posture, identify weaknesses, and implement fixes before a vulnerability becomes critical.

In this lab, you’ll set up a workflow to scan the HTTP headers of your web application using `Mozilla Observatory`.
